## Private Events

## Description
Build a site similar to a private <b>Eventbrite</b> which allows users to create events and then manage user signups. Users can create events and send invitations and parties (sound familiar?). Events take place at a specific date and at a location (which you can just store as a string, like “Andy’s House”).
